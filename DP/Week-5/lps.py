# This is a straught forward solution . finding the longest common subsequence between and s1 and the reverse of s1
# would give us the longest palidromic subsequence . everything remains same 

# reason to reverse the string and find the longest common seubsequence to find longest palindromic substring :

# The longest palindromic subsequence being a palindrome will remain the same when the entire string is reversed.
# The length of the palindromic subsequence will also remain the same when the entire string is reversed.
